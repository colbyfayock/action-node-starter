# GitHub Action Node.js Starter

A simple repository starter for creating a new local workflow with Github Actions.

## Getting Started

To start a new project, you can either use [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) by running:

```
mkdir my-action
cd my-action
npx degit https://github.com/colbyfayock/action-node-starter
```

Or you can use the Template feature and click [Use This Template](https://github.com/colbyfayock/action-node-starter/generate) at the top of this page to create a new repository.
